Employed Ctrl + T to convert the dataset into a table for easier manipulation and analysis.

2. Matches Win Analysis:
   
-> Pivot Table Creation:
Developed a Pivot Table on a new sheet to analyze matches won by teams, focusing on winner and toss winner, toss decision using a stacked column chart.

-> Visualization:
Named the Pivot Table as "Matches Win" for easy reference.

Created a stacked column chart to visually represent the relationship between the winner, toss winner, and toss decision.

Provided data points such as 283 wins when batting first and 413 wins when fielding first.

4. Top 10 Venue Analysis:
 
-> Top 10 Venues:

Applied a value filter in the Pivot Table to isolate the top 10 venues based on toss decision and winner.

Presented the findings using a stacked bar chart for clear visualization.

5. Man of the Match Analysis:
