Analysing IPL data begins with importing and cleaning in Excel, utilizing features like PivotTables and charts for player stats and team performance.

Raw data collection in the context of the Indian Premier League (IPL) is pivotal for comprehensive cricket analysis and strategic decision-making. Player statistics, match results, and team performance metrics constitute the raw data that shapes insights into player contributions, team strategies, and overall tournament dynamics. This data aids in player selection, allowing teams to optimize their line-ups based on performance metrics. Furthermore, it enables the identification of trends, strengths, and weaknesses, guiding teams in refining strategies throughout the tournament. Beyond the game, raw data on fan engagement, financial aspects, broadcasting rights, and historical trends contributes to the league's success. It empowers stakeholders to make informed decisions on marketing, sponsorships, and financial planning. In essence, the importance of raw data in the IPL extends from the cricket field to business and management, fostering a data-driven approach for sustained success and growth in one of the most popular cricket leagues globally.
